# OCR_modified
This is the source code of our OCR modified version.

<p style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: 30px; text-align:justify;">Hi, welcome to this website. We are pleased to show you the
		modified version of the original <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/ocr/code" target="_blank">OCR</a>.
		Before this, I would like to give a brief introduction on the original OCR.
		<br /><br />
		OCR, standing for Optical Character Recognition, is originally proposed by Marina Samuel for utilizing the ANN(artificial neural network)
		 to recognizthe digits ranging from 0 to 9. The detailed introduction of OCR can be found in
		<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/500L/optical-character-recognition-ocr.html" target="_blank">
			http://aosabook.org/en/500L/optical-character-recognition-ocr.html</a>
		<br /><br />
		So what did we do on the original version?<br />
		1) We improved the web page appearance of the OCR, including the layout, the design of the canvas, the title and logo of this web
		 . <br />
		2) We added more content into the html to make it easier for people to understand and use.<br />
		3) We added a function that can visually show the sample from the train set on the web page, which gives users better understanding
		 on the training samples used in OCR.(To use this function, just click "show one sample" button.)<br />
		4) We added a function that enables users to upload a image containing English characters and return a corresponding recognition result. This funtion can
		be used in the bottom of the web page.
